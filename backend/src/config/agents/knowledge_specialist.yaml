  # tools will be auto-discovered from the 'gcp-rag' MCP server if connected?
  # The seeding logic seeds the agent config. But how does the agent get the TOOLS?
  # The framework likely attaches tools based on some logic or they are available in the 'mcp-tool-universe'.
  # For now, we define the agent. The Architect/Orchestrator usually decides which tools to give,
  # OR the registry binds specific MCP servers to specific agents.
  # If the system uses a global toolset, this agent will pick the RAG tools.
  # If not, we might need a 'tool_servers' field here?
  # The user request implies "seed as specialized agents", so we create the agent config.
